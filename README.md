🎓 Honest Internships – Help Students Find the Right Internship
About the Project
Honest Internships is a platform created to help students find trustworthy and valuable internship opportunities. Many students end up at companies that make false promises or fail to provide proper guidance. I've experienced this myself, and that's exactly why I started this project – to make sure others won’t face the same issues.

Why This Matters
Internships are a crucial part of a student’s development. A bad internship can lead to missed learning opportunities and frustration. This project aims to provide transparency by allowing students to rate and review the companies where they’ve done their internships. Over time, this will create a reliable database of trusted companies – and also flag those that treat interns poorly.

How It Works
Students can rate and review the companies they interned at.

The platform will collect and display this feedback for future students.

Schools and educators will be encouraged to share the platform and get their students involved.

Eventually, we want to partner with organizations like SBB (Samenwerkingsorganisatie Beroepsonderwijs Bedrijfsleven) to take action against consistently poorly-rated companies.

Vision for the Future
The long-term goal is to work with educational institutions and companies to improve the overall internship experience. By building a trusted network of reviews and verified data, we can help students avoid bad internships and promote companies that truly support learning and growth.
